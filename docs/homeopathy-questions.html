        	<h2>Questions & Answers</h2>
    
    			<h3>Why choose homeopathy?</h3>
    
    			<div>
    				<p>Homeopathy is a safe, effective and natural form of medicine. It treats the whole person; mentally and emotionally as well as physically. Homeopathy treats each person individually based on their particular symptom picture which includes their reactions to illnesses, life style, personality and medical history. Homeopathy views the symptoms of disease as an expression of the body's attempt to correct an underlying imbalance. It supports and stimulates the body's ability to heal itself and resolve the underlying imbalance.</p>
    			</div>
    
    
    			<h3>Who is suitable for homeopathic treatment?</h3>
    
    			<div>
    				<p>Anyone can benefit from homeopathic treatment. Because homeopathy treats the whole person and not just the symptoms of disease, it can be used to treat many different types of illness. It has a special affinity for emotional problems and physical illnesses with an emotional causation.</p>
    			</div>
    
    			<h3>How are homeopathic remedies made?</h3>
    
    			<div>
    				<p>Homeopathic remedies are made from a wide range of substances from the animal, plant, mineral and energy kingdoms. The basic material goes through a series of dilutions and succussions (a vigorous banging action) to make the remedy. This process is known as potentisation. It harnesses the substances innate healing properties while simultaneously removing any harmful properties by dilution. This allows homeopaths to use many substances that otherwise would not be safe to take as a medicine. Homeopathic remedies are non-addictive, non-toxic and have no side chemical effects.</p>
    			</div>
    
    			<h3>What is the difference between homeopathy and conventional medicine?</h3>
    
    			<div>
    				<p>Modern Medicine focuses primarily on the physical symptoms of disease and looks for what is the same between patients. It then applies a uniform treatment to the disease. Homeopaths look for what is different, what makes each person unique. Homeopathy views disease is an expression of an imbalance of the whole person and it is the whole person that needs to be healed, as well the symptoms of their disease. In homeopathy the remedy is individualized to the patient, with the intent of removing the underlying cause of the illness.</p>
    			</div>
    
    			<h3>How long does the treatment take to work?</h3>
    
    			<div>
    				<p>The response to treatment varies from one person to another and from one type of condition to another. An acute problem such as muscle cramps can disappear almost immediately. Chronic conditions usually take a longer amount of time to heal. The healing process unfolds at it's own pace which is beyond the control of either myself or the client. However you should begin to see some improvements in your health within the first 3-4 appointments.</p>
    			</div>
    
    			<h3>Do I need to be registered with a local GP?</h3>
    
    			<div>
    				<p>Yes I insist that everyone I treated is registered with a GP / surgery in there local area. I will be unable to work with someone if they are unwilling to resister with a local GP.</p>
    			</div>
    
    
    			<h3>Do I need a referral from my doctor?</h3>
    
    			<div>
    				<p>You do not require a referral. Most people usually come to see me because I have been recommended by a friend or relative.</p>
    			</div>
    
    			<h3>Do I have to stop taking my medication?</h3>
    
    			<div>
    				<p>I would never suggest that a patient should immediately withdraw from their medication. If you are on medication when you first come to see me I will adjust the treatment to account for this. In time as your health improves I might suggest that you discuss decreasing your medication with your GP. I usually insist that patients have shown significant and stable improvement before this is attempted. If you are taking medication on an ‘as needed’ basis, you should find yourself requiring it less frequently as your health improves.</p>
    			</div>
    
    			<h3>How do homeopathic remedies work?</h3>
    
    			<div>
    				<p>The exact mechanism by which homeopathy works is unknown according to the scientific community. However there is growing evidence that it is linked to the phenomenon in physics known as coherence. Also 200 years of clinical experience along with research published in such medical journals as The Lancet, Pediatrics and the British Medical Journal have confirmed homeopathy’s effectiveness.</p>
    			</div>
    
    			<h3>Do remedies have side-effects?</h3>
    
    			<div>
    				<p>No they do not. In theory, the medicines can cause symptoms to worsen for a short period of time before they begin to improve. This is known as a homeopathic aggravation. In practice, careful selection of the remedy and potency (strength) usually ensures that this effect is minimized. Most people do not experience an aggravation during homeopathic treatment.</p>
    
    			</div>
    
    			<h3>Do my symptoms have to get worse before they get better?</h3>
    
    			<div>
    				<p>An aggravation of your symptoms is a relatively uncommon occurrence. It is not essential to the success of the treatment. It is usually possible to select a remedy and potency to prevent this from occurring. If an aggravation does occur further treatment will help to minimize the discomfort.</p>
    			</div>
    
    			<h3>Will homeopathic remedies interfere with my medication?</h3>
    
    			<div>
    				<p>Unlike conventional medication, homeopathic remedies have an energetic rather than a direct chemical affect on the body. Therefore they won’t interfere with any medication you may be taking during homeopathic treatment. It is generally fine to take homeopathic remedies alongside prescription drugs. It is possible for certain drugs to block the action of homeopathic remedies but the treatment can usually be adjusted to overcome this problem.</p>
