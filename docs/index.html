          <p>My interest in holistic medicine began in 2001 when I began to look beyond mainstream science and explore other philosophical ideas. This interest developed into a fascination with the relationship between the mind and body and the role our thoughts & emotions play in maintaining or disrupting our health and general sense of wellbeing. My approach to healing is to treat the whole person, not just the symptoms of their illness. I seek to help my clients resolve blocks on the mental and emotional level which makes energy available for healing on a physical level. I use Homeopathy and Reiki to facilitate this process.  </p>

          <h2 class="section-header">Healing with Homeopathy</h2>
    
          <p>Homeopathy is a safe, effective and natural form of holistic medicine. It works gently and safely to raise the vitality and wellbeing of the whole person, bringing balance and harmony to the emotions, mind and physical body. Homeopathy works primarily at the emotional level, helping to heal fixed patterns of feeling, thought and behaviour. How we feel about ourselves and the world around us, greatly affects our emotional and physical wellbeing. Over time habitual negative emotional states such as anger, anxiety, depression, grief, sadness, stress and shame take their toll on the body, eventually manifesting as physical illness. The application of the correct homeopathic remedy can help resolve the fixed negative emotions that people get stuck in. Homeopathic treatment gives the client the opportunity to move forward and experience greater levels of vitality and emotional and physical wellbeing.</p>

          <h2 class="section-header">Healing with Reiki</h2>
    
          <p>A Reiki treatment temporarily restores the smooth flow of chi (energy) around the body. It charges the body and tissues with clean revitalising energy, bringing balance and harmony to the mind, emotions and physical body. A deep sense of comfort and relaxation is commonly experienced during a Reiki treatment. Reiki stimulates an individual’s self-healing process. It can improve emotional wellbeing by encouraging the release of suppressed emotions. It can also balance the physical systems, flushing toxins from the body, balancing the endocrine system, boosting the immune system and strengthen the body's ability to heal itself. Reiki can improve long term physical health and achieve lasting healing by encouraging the release of coarse negative energies which are often the cause of emotional and physical illness.</p>
