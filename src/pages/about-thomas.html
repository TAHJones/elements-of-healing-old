    				<p>My journey to becoming a healer began in 2001 when I began to look beyond mainstream science and explore other philosophical ideas. This interest developed into a fascination with the relationship between the mind and body and the role our thoughts & emotions play in maintaining or disrupting our health and general sense of wellbeing.</p>

      	<h2 class="section-header">My Scientific Background</h2>
    
    		<p>Before becoming a holistic healer, I worked in the field of genetics and molecular biology. I achieved a 1st class degree in genetics in 1997 and continued my career in mainstream science for several years. I began my scientific career in academia using molecular mapping techniques to characterise individual genes. I then moved into the private sector where I was involved in several large scale genotyping projects and the development of ‘next generation’ DNA sequencing technology. I currently work as a healthcare scientist as well as running my own Homeopathic practice.</p>

    				<p>I became a fully qualified homeopath in 2007, after training for four years (2003-2007) at the country’s largest homeopathic college; The Centre for Homeopathic Education. Since becoming a homeopath I continued to develop my skills as a healer. For two years (2007-2009) I attended a postgraduate course in Homeopathy. On this course I studied the Kingdom Method, an approach which identifies basic differences in people’s personalities that correspond to energetic patterns from the animal, plant and mineral kingdoms.</p>

      	<h2 class="section-header">Beyond Homeopathy</h2>
    
    	<p>Perhaps the biggest weakness of the homeopathic method is that energy is only really understood from a theoretical perspective. In order to address this limitation in my own understanding I decided to study other methods of healing. I found reiki to be particularly interesting. Working with reiki energy has allowed me to experience the reality of the universal life force (energy) in a very visceral way. Over the years I have continued to study the many aspects of reiki and energy healing. This has greatly improved my skills as a healer and has informed the way I now practice homeopathy.</p>

    	<p>I am a qualified reiki practitioner having received my 1st and 2nd degree in 2008-2009. I became a fully qualified Reiki Master in 2009. I belong to the Golden Reiki Way Lineage and am a member of the Beyond Reiki School which belongs to the Usui tradition of natural healing.</p>
