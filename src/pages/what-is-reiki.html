	  <h2 class="section-header">What is Reiki?</h2>

		<p>Put simply, Reiki is the application of universal life energy for the purposes of healing. The word Reiki means ‘Universal Life Energy’ and originates from the Japanese words ‘Rei’ (Universal) and ‘Ki’ (Life Energy). It is an ancient method of energy healing that originated in Tibet thousands of years ago. It was rediscovered in Sanskrit sutras by Dr Mikao Usui (1865–1926) who introduced it as a system of healing in Japan in the late 19th century.</p>

	  <h2 class="section-header">How Does Reiki Work?</h2>

		<p>The Reiki practitioner doesn’t directly heal the client, but acts as a conduit for Reiki energy to stimulate the client’s own healing process. Reiki flows through the subtle energy system and physical tissues, charging them with clean healthy energy. It cleanses and balances the energy centre’s and strengthens the energy pathways restoring the body’s natural energy flow.</p>

		<h2 class="section-header">The Healing Effects of Reiki</h2>

		<p>Reiki stimulates an individual’s self-healing process. Therefore it affects each person in a unique and personal way. During a Reiki treatment a whole range of sensations may occur. A deep sense of comfort and relaxation is most commonly experienced. Some people become very sleepy during a treatment, others feel highly energized. Reiki can improve emotional well being by encouraging the release of suppressed emotions. It can also balance the physical systems, flushing toxins from the body, balancing the endocrine system, boosting the immune system and strengthen the body's ability to heal itself.</p>

	  			<h4>Sacred Space</h4>

					<p>The term sacred space refers to an environment that has been specifically prepared for the purposes of energy healing. For a healing encounter to be successful the appropriate energetic boundaries must be set in place beforehand. Sacred space provides the optimum conditions for a clean and healing energy exchange to occur during the Reiki treatment.</p>

		<h2 class="section-header">An Energetic View of Disease</h2>

		<p>Energy flows through the body’s energy centers and energy pathways as well as flowing outside the body in an energy field called the aura. This subtle energy system animates the body and responds to everything we think, say, feel, and experience. It can be disrupted or blocked when we absorb negative words, thoughts, feelings or experiences. These experiences can then form permanent blockages in the energy body, gradually becoming denser over time. As the flow of energy through the subtle energy system becomes increasingly compromised this results in mental, emotion or physical dysfunction and eventually causes disease.

  	<h2 class="section-header">How Does Energy Healing Work?</h2>

  	<p>Energy healing works because we are energetic as well as physical beings. Energy therapies improve health by encouraging the release of dense, negative energies that impede and natural flow of energy around the body. Different therapies interact with our energy system in different ways; acupuncture restores the flow of energy by unblocking the meridian channels,  homeopathy restores energetic coherence by removing negative energies from the auric field, reiki removes negative energies and blockages from the energy body by stimulating the flow of energy to the major energy centres and meridian channels.</p>
