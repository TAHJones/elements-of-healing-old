        <p>This is one of the clinics treatment rooms which I use for reiki treatments. The treatment space at the clinic is clean, comfortable and private, making it ideal for healing work. A full treatment lasts for approximately 90 minutes.</p>

    <p>Before the treatment can begin the client must be made fully aware of the issues relating to there complaint. Therefore the session always begins with a 15-20 minute consultation.</p>

        <p>Once the client is ready to receive treatment I need their permission to proceed. Therefore before beginning the treatment I require them to fill in a consent form. The form is relatively straight forward and requires the client to provide some basic information about themselves; this includes their full name, address, date of birth, phone no. and email address. I also ask for the name and address of the clients GP (I insist that anyone I see for reiki treatment is registered with a local GP), an overview of the client’s medical history and the reason why the client has sought reiki treatment. Once the client has completed the form they sign and date it so we are able to proceed with the treatment.</p>

    <h2 class="section-header">The Treatment</h2>

    <p>Once consent has been given the client then lies facing upwards on a treatment couch while the practitioner transmits Reiki energy, via the hands, to the client’s body. During the process the client is fully clothed and covered with a blanket to keep them warm. Firstly the practitioner treats the client’s front, beginning at the head and working down the body towards the feet. Once the sequence is complete the practitioner treats the clients back, beginning again at the head and working their way down to the feet for a second time. The hand positions for a Reiki treatment cover the major energy centre’s and other important points of the subtle energy system. Reiki is applied at each hand position for approximately 5 minutes. At the end of the treatment the clients is given 5-10 minutes to process the experience and let the energies settle.</p>

        <p>A full Reiki treatment lasts approximately 90 minutes (including an initial 15-20 minute consultation) and is usually given as part of a sequence of three treatments. Each of these sessions has a different part to play in the healing process and brings a different energy to the sequence of treatments. The three treatments can be delivered in quick succession or over a longer period of time, depending on the needs and circumstances of the client.</p>

        <p>The first treatment is yang in nature and primarily treats the male (right) side. It clarifies what needs to be healed and focuses on the clients 'core' issue. The second treatment is yin in nature and primarily treats the female (left) side. It clears impediments to progress and brings hidden obstacles to the surface to be addressed and released. The third treatment clears away energetic debris and tidies up 'loose ends'. It reintegrates the male and females energies after the first and second treatment. It energetically grounds the client, enabling them to integrate the healing that has occurred and leave behind that which has become redundant and unhealthy.</p>

    <h2 class="section-header">Short Sitting Treatments</h2>

    <p>Short treatments usually last for 30 minutes and are given with the client sitting upright in a chair. They are a useful option when circumstances dictate that a series of full treatments is inappropriate. Short treatments can also be given for short term symptom relief, for relaxation or to give the client an energetic 'pick me up'. They can also be given as a single 'taster' session for those who are merely curious and want to experience Reiki energy for themselves.</p>
