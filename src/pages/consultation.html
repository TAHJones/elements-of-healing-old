        <p>This is one of the clinics counselling rooms which I use for homeopathic consultations. The rooms at the clinic are clean, comfortable and private, making them ideal for healing work. A homeopathic consultation with me lasts for approximately 40 minutes.</p>

    <h2 class="section-header">Gaining Consent</h2>

    <p>Before the consultation can begin I must have the consent of the client. Therefore the first thing I require them to do is fill in a consent form. The form is relatively straight forward and requires the client to provide some basic information about themselves; this includes their full name, address, date of birth, phone no. and email address. I also ask for the name and address of the clients GP (I insist that anyone I see for homeopathic treatment is registered with a local GP), an overview of the client’s medical history and the reason why the client has sought homeopathic treatment. Once the client has completed the form, they sign and date it so that I have their consent to begin the consultation.</p>

    <h2 class="section-header">The Presenting Complaint</h2>

    <p>The consultation begins with me asking the client a series of questions relating to their presenting complaint. This is the central issue of the case and the reason the client has sought homeopathic treatment. Therefore a significant amount of time is taken to understand this aspect of the case. To ensure that I get a sufficient understanding of the clients presenting complaint I use a system of symptom analysis known as 'CLAMS'.</p>

    <p>Usually a client will spontaneously tell me one or two aspects of their complaint e.g. 'I have a splitting (sensation) headache (location)'. I will then use the CLAMS system to complete the symptom picture.</p>

    <h2 class="section-header">Treating the Whole Person</h2>

    <p>Perhaps the most important aspect of taking the case is being able to truly understand the person seeking my help. Homeopathy treats the whole person, not just the symptoms of disease. It is crucial that I have an understanding of how the client’s problem affects them as a whole person before I can prescribe a curative remedy. Therefore I ask the client a broad range of questions which can include any of the following:</p>

    <p>Another appointment is usually arranged in a month’s time. This gives the remedy plenty of time to work and allows me to assess its effect on the client’s health. Sometimes follow up consultations are made more frequently depending on the individual needs of the client and the nature of their condition.</p>
