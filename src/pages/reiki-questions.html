      <h2>Questions & Answers</h2>

      <h3>How Does Reiki Work?</h3>

      <div>
        <p>The Reiki practitioner doesn’t directly heal the client, but acts as a conduit for Reiki energy to stimulate the client’s own healing process. Reiki flows through the subtle energy system and physical tissues, charging them with clean healthy energy. It cleanses and balances the energy centre’s and strengthens the energy pathways restoring the body’s natural energy flow.</p>

      <h3>How long does the treatment take to work?</h3>

      <div>
        <p>The response to treatment varies from one person to another and from one type of condition to another. An acute problem such as a headache can disappear almost immediately. Chronic conditions usually take a longer amount of time to heal. The healing process unfolds at it's own pace which is beyond the control of either myself or the client. However you should see some improvements in your health after the first series of treatments.</p>

      <h3>Who is suitable for reiki treatment?</h3>

      <div>
        <p>Anyone can benefit from reiki. This is because reiki treats the whole person and not just the symptoms of disease, it can be used to treat many different types of illness.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>How will I react to a reiki treatment?</h3>

      <div>
        <p>Reiki stimulates an individual’s self-healing process. Therefore it affects each person in a unique and personal way. During a Reiki treatment a whole range of sensations may occur. A deep sense of comfort and relaxation is most commonly experienced. Some people become very sleepy during a treatment, others feel highly energized. Reiki can improve emotional well being by encouraging the release of suppressed emotions. It can also balance the physical systems, flushing toxins from the body, balancing the endocrine system, boosting the immune system and strengthen the body's ability to heal itself.</p>

      <h3>What is the difference between reiki and conventional medicine?</h3>

      <div>
        <p>Modern medicine focuses primarily on the physical symptoms of disease and looks for what is the same between patients. It then applies a uniform treatment to the disease. Reiki views disease is an expression of an imbalance of the whole person and it is the whole person that needs to be healed, as well the symptoms of their disease.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Do I need to be registered with a local GP?</h3>

      <div>
        <p>Yes I insist that everyone I treated is registered with a GP / surgery in there local area. I will be unable to work with someone if they are unwilling to resister with a local GP.</p>
      </div>


      <h3>Do I need a referral from my doctor?</h3>

      <div>
        <p>You do not require a referral. Most people usually come to see me because I have been recommended by a friend or relative.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Do I have to stop taking my medication?</h3>

      <div>
        <p>No. I never suggest that a patient should immediately withdraw from their medication. If you are on medication when you first come to see me I will adjust the treatment to account for this. In time as your health improves you should discuss decreasing your medication with your doctor. I usually insist that patients have shown significant and stable improvement before this is attempted. If you are taking medication on an ‘as needed’ basis, you should find yourself requiring it less frequently as your health improves.</p>

      </div>

      <h3>Do my symptoms have to get worse before they get better?</h3>

      <div>
        <p>An aggravation of your symptoms is a relatively uncommon occurrence. It is certainly not an essential part of the healing process. However the first treatment (in a series of three) shines a light on what needs to be healed. This can sometimes be an uncomfortable process for those new to reiki. This temporary discomfort can be minimised by quickly moving through the sequence of three treatments and is outweighed by the overall health benefits of the process.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Will reiki treatment interfere with my medication?</h3>

      <div>
        <p>Unlike conventional medication, reiki treatment has an energetic rather than a direct chemical affect on the body. Therefore the process won’t interfere with any medication you may be currently taking. Overtime as your health improves it maybe necessary to discuss with your doctor a reduction in your medication.</p>
