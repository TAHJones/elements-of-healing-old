  	<h2 class="section-header">The Elemental Sequence</h2>

	<p>The other aspects of the universal life force, often referred to in shamanic terminology as the elemental forces of Water, Fire, Air and Spirit, can also be employed for the purposes of healing. The sequence of treatments is initially fixed. The client encounters each of the elements in five separate sessions in the order; Earth, Air, Spirit, Water and Fire. The order of subsequent treatments is then determined by the individual needs of the client.</p>

	<h2 class="section-header">Our Relationship with the Elements</h2>

	<p>The strength or weakness of our relationship with each of the elements shapes our personality at a fundamental level. Working with the elements can help us to better understand our strengths and weaknesses, likes and dislikes, our greatest hopes and deepest fears. They are closely linked to our particular susceptibility to illness and disease. The elements have there own inner life which can guide our own healing process and become our personal medicine. They can help heal our dis-ease and facilitate our growth and personal development. Awareness of who you are and your relationship to the elemental forces of Earth, Water, Fire, Air and Spirit is half the battle in developing personal power, inner harmony and physical well being.</p>
