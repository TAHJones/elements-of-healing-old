	<p><!-- Although I reply to most enquires, please be aware that is not always possible for me to respond directly. This is a necessary boundary condition set in place for my own wellbeing. Not all personalities and energy systems are compatible for this work and I only have limited time and energy available to support clients engaged in the healing process. For healing to occur consent and permission to proceed must come from all levels of the clients being (conscious and unconscious). Sadly this is not always the case. --> Many people, having only experienced orthodox medicine, contact me seeking relief from their symptoms but are unwilling to explore the deeper reasons for their problems. In this fast paced modern age immediate solutions are often expected. The healing process does not yield to such demands and unfolds at it's own pace. This process is beyond the control of either myself or those seeking my help and must be respected. I endeavor to take on all cases where it is appropriate for me to do so and will refer people when necessary.</p>
